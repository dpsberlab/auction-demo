# Auction demo

This article will be about a small demonstration of using the Sharemind MPC
platform.

## Storyline

[Not every problem needs to be solved with Sharemind][Sharemind problem]. I
chose a very simple problem that has 3 stakeholders: Alice, Bob and Charlie
(sorry for being so unimaginative with the names).

The story goes that Charlie wants to sell his house on the beach. Potential
buyers are Alice and Bob, who both are real-estate speculators who compete with
each-other. Charlie is interested in the highest bidder and wants to hold a
auction. Alice and Bob both want to make a bid, but since they are competing in
the same district they do not want to reveal their bids. So Charlie proposes to make
the auction closed.

So far Sharemind is still not needed: Alice and Bob can write their bids on a
piece of paper, put it into an envelope, close the envelope and give it to
Charlie, who will determine the winner. Charlie promises to not reveal the
losing bid.

However, Alice is not happy with that plan. She is afraid that if Bob wins the
auction and is going to celebrate the house deal with Charlie, it would be very
easy for Bob to persuade Charlie into giving him information about the amount
Alice was willing to pay. That information would give Bob an edge over Alice in
further deals.
